# Todo

## Implementing
- [ ] changing UART subsystem to not use blocking mode for receiving (Interrupt or DMA, maybe using a circ buf)
- [ ] develop LCD driver
- [ ] develop Soil Moisture Driver
- [ ] develop Ultrasonic Distance Driver
- [ ] build system with sensors, tank and plant


## Designing
- [x] Finalizing how the whole system behaves and works
- [ ] draw system architecture diagrams
- [ ] design scheduler to be used in active mode
- [ ]

## Planning
- [ ] get Soil Moisture Sensor
- [ ] get Peristaltic Pump
- [ ] get LCD Screen
- [ ] get Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
