# Week 6 Exercise

## Task: Write draft of Final Project Report
> Review the final project instructions. Put together a preliminary rough draft of your final report.
> This is intended to be a planning exercise, not that you should have your project complete
> (though it makes the report easier to write if you put it in present/past tense instead of putting
> in “should” and “shall”).
> 
> As you work through the draft final report, note where you might have trouble. Make a list of
> the tasks you want to complete for the project. Make a list of the minimum viable project and
> any blocking items (unacquired hardware, difficulty with toolchains).
> 
> Include any relevant pieces from past assignments (such as the state machine documentation
> from the recent exercise).
